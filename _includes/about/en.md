Hey, I'm Cao Sheng, a programmer who enjoy life and aspire to explore the bigger world. Born in 1999, I earned my Bachelor of Software Engineering with Honors from the Australian National University. For my graduate studies, I moved to the National University of Singapore, with major in Computer Science specialisation. With a solid academic background, I am proficient in programming languages like Java, Go, Python, and I am determined to become an excellent backend developer. I dream of starting my own business one day and achieving financial freedom early!
